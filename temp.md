❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum(){ return a+b; }
```

Issues:
* ❌ **Undeclared Variables:** The variables `a` and `b` are not defined within the function's scope or passed as
parameters. This will result in a `ReferenceError` when the function is called.
* ❌ **Lack of Input Parameters:** A `sum` function typically expects the values to be summed as arguments. The current
signature `sum()` implies it takes no inputs, but then tries to use `a` and `b`.
* ❌ **Poor Readability & Maintainability:** Without explicit parameters, it's unclear what `a` and `b` are intended to
be, making the code harder to understand and debug.
* ❌ **No Error Handling/Validation:** There's no mechanism to handle cases where `a` or `b` might not be numbers, which
could lead to unexpected `NaN` results (e.g., `1 + undefined` is `NaN`).

Recommended Fix:
```javascript
/**
* Sums two numbers.
* @param {number} num1 - The first number.
* @param {number} num2 - The second number.
* @returns {number} The sum of num1 and num2.
*/
function sum(num1, num2) {
if (typeof num1 !== 'number' || typeof num2 !== 'number') {
console.error("sum(): Both arguments must be numbers.");
// Or throw new TypeError("Both arguments must be numbers.");
return NaN; // Or a more appropriate error value
}
return num1 + num2;
}

// Example Usage:
// console.log(sum(5, 3)); // 8
// console.log(sum("hello", 3)); // Logs error and returns NaN
```

💡 Improvements:
* ✔ **Clear Parameters:** The function now explicitly accepts `num1` and `num2` as parameters, making its purpose clear.
* ✔ **Type Validation/Error Handling:** Added a basic check to ensure both inputs are numbers, providing a more robust
function.
* ✔ **Enhanced Readability:** Using descriptive parameter names (`num1`, `num2`) improves clarity.
* ✔ **JSDoc Documentation:** Added comments (`/** ... */`) to describe the function's purpose, parameters, and return
value, adhering to best practices for maintainability and discoverability.

Final Note:
Always ensure that function inputs are clearly defined and that basic validation is in place, especially for functions
that perform mathematical operations. This prevents unexpected runtime errors and makes your code more predictable and
maintainable.
